    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Who doesn't love the idea of a nice, tangy buffalo chicken sandwich? And who

    is absolutely no one.</p>
    <p>Get ready for some delicious, heavenly sandwiches that will make your neighbors
    jealous. You know they are watching you through binoculars, judging every meal you make
    and thinking to themselves "Man, I can cook better than that!". Time to ruin their weeks.
    This recipe will shut them up. They will forever hang their heads in shame once
    they see what you're capable of. It's your time to shine, baby.
