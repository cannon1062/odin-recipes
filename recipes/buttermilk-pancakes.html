    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sheet pan pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast hacks for busy mornings or 
    breakfast meal prep. The buttermilk makes these baked pancakes light, fluffy, and 
    oh-so-delicious! This sheet pan pancake recipe can be easily customized by adding 
    your favorite fruit or other pancake toppings on top of the batter before cooking.</p>
    <p>Everyone on earth knows how to make pancakes. If you don't, you are lying to me
    and you are lying to yourself. So why even bother with this recipe? Well I will tell you!
    We are going to church it up! We are getting out the sheet pan in an effort to over-complicate
    an American breakfast staple. This recipe is for those who want to act better than
    everyone else but are too inept to make something more than pancakes. After eating these
    you can get back to writing your novel and recording your podcast.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick)</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a sheet pan 
        (approx. 13 x18 inches) or jelly roll pan (12x17 inches) with parchment paper. 
        Spray the parchment paper with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine baking mix, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in 
        a large mixing bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well combined, but don't 
        over-mix. Pour batter onto the parchment paper-lined pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove sheet pan from the oven. Lift the parchment paper with the pancake 
        from the pan and set it onto a cutting board. Slice the pancake sheet into squares 
        using a pizza cutter or into your desired shapes with a cookie cutter.</li>
    </ol>
