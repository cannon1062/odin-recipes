# odin-recipes

Welcome to my first Odin project! This project will demonstrate everything I have learned up to this point. This includes:
- Using Git and GitHub
- Using proper file structure
- Basic html coding which includes:
    - Creating pages with text
    - Linking images
    - Linking to other pages I've made and possibly other places on the web!

After finishing, I will update with a summary of how it went. 

(I added the below at the end of the first project. Will edit and update in the future.)

This project actually turned out to be more fun than it seemed like it could be. There is a certain satisfaction to typing out code and having it do stuff on the webpage. HTML doesn't seem like such a daunting, jumbled mess when you're the one who wrote it from scratch.
