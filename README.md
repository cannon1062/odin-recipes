# odin-recipes

Welcome to my first Odin project! This project will demonstrate everything I have learned up to this point. This includes:
- Using Git and GitHub
- Using proper file structure
- Basic html coding which includes:
    - Creating pages with text
    - Linking images
    - Linking to other pages I've made and possibly other places on the web!

After finishing, I will update with a summary of how it went.
